1. from raw results (no preprocessing) - we find that SVR performs the best

Ways to improve:
- use PCR as part of training for RFS

- drop rows with no RFS

Lvl 1: data imputation
    1. use median for missing values
    2. drop all rows with any missing value
    3. use model to fill in gene and use median for the rest
- use raw predictions to finf best

Lvl 2 - Feature selection:
    1. PCA on mri 
        - explore corrolation
    2. PCA on all but three mandatory fields
    3. Manifold learning

lvl 3 - train
    1. SVM raw
    2. SVM grid search
