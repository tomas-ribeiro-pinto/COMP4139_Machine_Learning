1. from raw results (no preprocessing) - we find that SVR performs the best

Ways to improve:
- use PCR as part of training for RFS

- drop rows with no RFS

Lvl 1: data imputation
    1. use median for missing values
    2. drop all rows with any missing value
    3. use model to fill in gene and use median for the rest

- use raw predictions to find best
** gene_predicted_rest_median_imputed performs the best.

lvl 2: outlier removal (only non-mri data)
    1. replace outlier with median
    2. dropp outliers

Lvl 3 - Feature selection:
    1. PCA on mri 
        - explore corrolation
    2. PCA on all but three mandatory fields [ER, HER2, Gene]
    3. PCA on normally distributed mri fields
    4. Manifold learning



lvl 4 - train
    1. SVM raw
    2. SVM grid search
